# IST_719_Visualizing_Volcano_Data

Utilized various data visualization techniques to create a poster on a dataset detailing volcanic eruptions using R and Adobe Illustrator. 

Zachary_Chipman_Final_Poster.pdf: Poster for the IST719 final project.

Zachary_Chipman_Final_Poster.R: R code used to make plots shown in the poster. These plots will vary slightly to the ones in the final poster as some aesthetic edits were made in Adobe illustrator. R-studio will be required to view this file.

Although the data is included in this repository (database.csv), the source of this data will be included here and at the bottom of the poster:
